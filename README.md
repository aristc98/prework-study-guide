# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## I created this study guide to help new bootcamp students with all the new information they will be taking in. The guide contains notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a simple one page study guide that you can simple scroll down the page to read each topic. For suggestions, you can open ChromeDevTools(or inspect element) by using the command "command+option+I" for Mac OS or "Control+Shift+I" for windows and go to "console" where you will then see a recommendation.
